    "Q": "Explain Gaussian distribution with the help of its formula and curve. Also, mention at least 3 characteristics of this distribution.",
    "A": "Gaussian distribution, or normal distribution, is defined by the formula f(x) = (1 / (σ√(2π))) * e^(-((x - μ)²) / (2σ²)), where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. Characteristics include: 1. Symmetrical about the mean. 2. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. 3. The total area under the curve is 1.",
    "I": "The Gaussian formula is derived from the exponential function and describes the distribution of values in many natural phenomena."

    "Q": "Distinguish between convex and non-convex functions using their graphical representations. Can convex functions have saddle points?",
    "A": "Convex functions curve upwards, and any line segment connecting two points on the graph lies above the graph. Non-convex functions can curve downwards and may have regions where a line segment lies below the graph. Convex functions cannot have saddle points, which are points that are neither a local minimum nor maximum.",
    "I": "The definitions and graphical representations differentiate the two types of functions, emphasizing the properties of convexity."

    "A": "The probability density function for the beta distribution is f(x; α, β) = (x^(α-1) * (1-x)^(β-1)) / B(α, β), where B(α, β) = ∫(0 to 1) t^(α-1) * (1-t)^(β-1) dt. The chance that X is between 1/3 and 1/2 can be calculated using integration of the PDF over this interval.",

    "A": "Using Bayes' theorem, P(Disease | Positive) = (P(Positive | Disease) * P(Disease)) / P(Positive). Given P(Positive | Disease) = 0.95, P(Disease) = 0.01, and P(Positive) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99), the result is approximately 0.1604 or 16.04%.",
