For each question, indicate the best answer, using the directions given.
Notes: All numbers used are real numbers.
All figures are assumed to lie in a plane unless otherwise indicated. Geometric
figures, such as lines, circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals, are not necessarily
drawn to scale. That is, you should not assume that quantities such as lengths and
angle measures are as they appear in a figure. You should assume, however, that
lines shown as straight are actually straight, points on a line are in the order shown,
and more generally, all geometric objects are in the relative positions shown. For
questions with geometric figures, you should base your answers on geometric
reasoning, not on estimating or comparing quantities by sight or by measurement.
Coordinate systems, such as xy-planes and number lines, are drawn to scale;
therefore, you can read, estimate, or compare quantities in such figures by sight or
by measurement.
Graphical data presentations, such as bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs, are
drawn to scale; therefore, you can read, estimate, or compare data values by sight
or by measurement.
For each of Questions 1 to 9, compare Quantity A and Quantity B, using
additional information centered above the two quantities if such information is
given. Select one of the following four answer choices and fi ll in the corresponding
oval to the right of the question.
A
 Quantity A is greater.
B
 Quantity B is greater.
C
 The two quantities are equal.
D
 The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.
A symbol that appears more than once in a question has the same meaning
throughout the question.
