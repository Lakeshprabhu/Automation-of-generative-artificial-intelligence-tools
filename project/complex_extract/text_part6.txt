Banning Bicycles 
Narrator  
Read the article from a university newspaper. You will have 50 seconds to read the 
article. Begin reading now. 
Reading Time: 50 seconds 
University to Prohibit Bicycles on Campus 
Beginning next semester, the University will not allow the use of bicycles on campus. The campus 
sidewalks are intended for pedestrians and receive heavy pedestrian traffic. Several minor 
accidents have resulted from people on bicycles colliding with people walking, and although no 
one has been seriously hurt, University officials feel that bicycles pose a safety risk. Furthermore, 
the prohibition of bicycles will not be a problem for students, since the university currently 
operates a convenient alternative: the free campus bus system, which runs between all campus 
buildings. 
Narrator  
Now listen to a conversation between two students. 
Male Student  
Hey, Sue, did you see this article? 
Female  Student  
Yeah, I did. I don’t think that’s a very good idea. 
Male Student  
Really? You don’t think it’s a safety hazard, like they said? 
Female Student  
No—at least not during the day. I’m pretty sure both of those accidents happened 
at night, when it’s harder to see cyclists. They didn’t say that in the article.

Male Student  
Oh, that does make a difference. 
Female Student  
Sure it does. Maybe at night, with low visibility, there’s a safety hazard. But I 
don’t think there’s any danger in the daytime...which is when most people 
need to move around and get to classes. 
Male Student  
Yeah, that makes sense. 
Female Student  
Besides, it’s such a big campus, if they do this, it’s going to be really hard to 
get around. 
Male Student  
Well, we can always take the bus I guess. Female Student 
But the buses 
only run once an hour. 
Male Student  
That’s true. They’re not very convenient. 
Female Student  
No, not at all. If people have to take the bus, we’ll end up sitting around 
waiting for the next one all the time. And we’re all too busy to waste our time 
doing that.

Sample Response 
This is a mid-level response. 
Transcript: 
Well, the newspaper uh notice that uh the students cannot use bicycles because it is considered as 
a safe re…safe risk. But uh, the woman, the girl does not agree with it  uh…she thinks that first uh 
[pause] the bus uh the bus cause accident uh mainly because when it’s night people cannot see  
each other clearly and uh during daytime uh bike…a bicycle is very safe.  And the second, she  
thinks that  she  thinks  that  the campus  is  quite  big  and not  using  bicycles  causes  very  causes  very  
inconvenience to  uh get  to  classes.  And  finally  although  she  thinks  although  the  uh  campus  
support  provide  bus  but  it’s not..is…  
Rationale: 
The speaker seems to have understood some of the key points from the reading and the  
conversation. However, many important details are missing or incorrectly expressed in his  
response. For example, he incorrectly says that “the bus cause  accident” but the reading suggested 
that accidents on sidewalks occurred when bicycles ran into pedestrians.  Numerous vocabulary 
and grammar errors sometimes make  it difficult  to  understand  the  speaker’s  intended  message. For  
example,  it is  not  clear  what  is  meant by phrases such as “…very causes very inconvenience…”, 
or “…campus support provide bus…”  The speech is mostly clear and easy to understand, 
although the speaker repeats “uh” throughout the  responses, which is often distracting to the  
listener.

Speaking Practice Task 3 
Behavior Modification 
Narrator  
Now read the passage from a psychology textbook. You have 45 seconds to read the 
passage. Begin reading now. 
Reading Time: 45 seconds 
Behavior Modification 
Individuals often modify their behavior based on what they have learned about the possible 
consequences of their actions. When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior 
results in pleasant consequences, that behavior is likely to be repeated. An unpleasant consequence, 
on the other hand, discourages further repetition of the behavior. While behavior modification can 
be observed in experiments, it also occurs frequently in everyday settings, when individuals change 
their behavior based on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior. 
Narrator  
Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic in a psychology class. 
Male Professor  
This happens all the time with kids, in schools. Say there’s a little boy or girl 
who’s just starting school. Well, they’re not really used to the rules about 
proper behavior for a classroom, so at the beginning, they might, I don’t 
know, interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom when they’re 
supposed to be sitting down. You know, just misbehaving in general. OK, but 
what happens? Well, the teacher gets angry with them when they act this way.

They might get punished--they have to sit at their desks when everyone else 
is allowed to go outside and play. And they certainly don’t like that. 
Soon they’ll learn that this kind of behavior gets them in trouble. They’ll also 
learn that when they raise their hand to talk to the teacher and sit quietly and 
pay attention during class... they’re rewarded. The teacher tells them she’s  
proud of them, and maybe puts little happy-face stickers  on their homework.  
Now  that  their  behavior  gets  a  good  reaction from the teacher, the kids learn 
to always act this way in class... and not behave the way they used to.  
Using the example from the lecture, explain what behavior modification is and how it works. 
If this were an actual test question, you would have 30 seconds to prepare and 60 seconds to 
speak. 
Preparation  Time:  30 seconds  
Response  Time:  60 seconds  
In this practice test, you may use a timer to practice preparing and giving a response. If you 
can, record your answer and compare it to the sample response.

Sample Response 
This is a high-level response. 
Transcript: 
Behavior modification is defined as uh people’s, uh chan-people’s changing their behavior 
based on their experiences about the consequences of the behaviors. And according to 
reading too, the patt-um,  behavior  modification  can be  observed  both  in  experiments  and in  
real  life.  The  professor  gives a example of-of observation of the modification in real life  
about kids. First when kids first moved in school,  they  do  not  know the  rules,  so  they  do 
things  like,  uh, walking  around  when  they’re  not  supposed to or talking, uh, when teacher’s 
speaking. This behaviors will result in punishments like um, the teacher’s, uh, reproaching 
them about how inappropriate that is. And soon-soon--soon they learn to behave better, um, 
because uh if they learn to raise hands, um, and or keeps out in the class is more pleasant, 
teachers praise them, through this they learned, um, this behavior is better for them.  
Rationale: 
Overall, the speaker is clear and easy to understand. His pronunciation is generally good and 
he uses intonation effectively to express meaning. He is able to use a range of simple and 
complex grammatical structures and vocabulary to express his ideas, although he makes 
several minor errors such as errors in agreement (“this behaviors”) and dropping pronouns 
and articles (“learn to raise [their] hands”). These errors don’t obscure meaning for the 
listener. His vocabulary use is often very precise and effective (“…reproaching them about 
how inappropriate that is…”). His definition of behavior modification is clear and accurate. 
He is able to summarize key points from the lecture to support the definitions. 
Overall, this is a mostly coherent and accurate synthesis of the reading and listening material.

Speaking Practice Task 4 
Reliability vs Features 
Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in a business class. 
Female  Professor  
If a consumer has to choose between two products, what determines the 
choice? 
Assume  that someone, a  purchaser, is choosing between two products 
that cost the same.  OK?  If  people  have  a  choice  between  two identically  
priced products,  which one will they choose? They choose the one they 
think is of higher quality, of course. But what does it mean for a product 
to be a high-quality product? Well, business analysts usually speak of 
two major factors of quality—one factor is reliability, and the other is 
what we call features.  
So,  reliability.  What’s reliability?  Well,  a  product  is  reliable  if  it  works  
the  way  we  expect  it to  work, if  it  can  go a  reasonable  amount of time  
without  needing  repairs. If a product, a car for example, doesn’t work 
the way it should and needs repairs too soon, we say it’s [stress on the  
first syllable] unreliable. So, product reliability means, basically, the 
absence  of defects or problems that you weren’t expecting. [pause] It 
used to be that when people thought about product quality, they thought 
mainly about reliability. Today it’s different. People do still care about 
reliability, don’t get me  wrong. It’s just that manufacturing standards are  
so now  so high that, take cars for example, today, today’s cars all very 
reliable. So reliability is important, but it’s not gonna be the deciding 
factor.

So, if reliability isn’t the  deciding factor any more, what is? Features— 
all those extras, the things a product has that aren’t really necessary but 
that make it easier to use  or that make it cool: for example, new cars 
today are loaded with features like electric windows, sun roofs, air 
conditioning, stereos, and so forth. When people are comparing products 
today, they look at features—because reliability’s pretty  much  equal  
cross  the board.  And  that’s  why  manufacturers  include  so  many features 
in their products.
