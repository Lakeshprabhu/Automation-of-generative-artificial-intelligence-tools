E
 It was originally constructed in an architectural style that was considered
outmoded by the thirteenth or fourteenth century.
24. The author’s argument concerning Notre-Dame’s flying buttresses depends on which
of the following assumptions about the choir’s lower flyers?
A
 They accurately reproduce the decoration on the choir’s original lower flyers.
B
 They have a type of decoration used exclusively for exterior surfaces.
C
 They were the models for the choir’s original upper flyers.
D

E
 They were constructed after the nave’s flyers were constructed.
Question 25 is based on the following reading passage.
The average temperature of the lobster-rich waters off the coast of Foerkland has been
increasing for some years. In warmer water, lobsters grow faster. In particular, lobster
larvae take less time to reach the size at which they are no longer vulnerable to predation
by young cod, the chief threat to their survival. Consequently, the survival rate of lobster
larvae must be going up, and the lobster population in Foerkland’s coastal waters is bound
to increase.
25. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A
 There are indications that in recent years the fishing fleet operating off the coast
of Foerkland has been taking cod at an unsustainably high rate.
B
 The increase in water temperatures off Foerkland has not been as pronounced as
the increase in average soil temperatures in Foerkland.
C
 Because of their speeded-up growth, lobsters now get large enough to be legal
catch before they reach reproductive maturity.
D
 Even though lobsters grow faster in warmer waters, warmer waters have no effect
on the maximum size to which a lobster can eventually grow.
E
 Cod are a cold-water species, and the increasing water temperatures have caused
a northward shift in Foerkland’s cod population.

All figures are assumed to lie in a plane unless otherwise indicated.
Geometric figures, such as lines, circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals, are not
necessarily drawn to scale. That is, you should not assume that quantities such as
lengths and angle measures are as they appear in a figure. You should assume,
however, that lines shown as straight are actually straight, points on a line are in
the order shown, and more generally, all geometric objects are in the relative
positions shown. For questions with geometric figures, you should base your
answers on geometric reasoning, not on estimating or comparing quantities by
sight or by measurement.
Coordinate systems, such as xy-planes and number lines, are drawn to scale;
therefore, you can read, estimate, or compare quantities in such figures by sight or
by measurement.
Graphical data presentations, such as bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs, are
drawn to scale; therefore, you can read, estimate, or compare data values by sight
or by measurement.
For each of Questions 1 to 9, compare Quantity A and Quantity B, using additional information centered above
the two quantities if such information is given. Select one of the following four answer choices and fi ll in the
corresponding oval to the right of the question.

 Quantity A is greater.
B
 Quantity B is greater.
C
 The two quantities are equal.

In a quality-control test, 50 boxes—each containing 30 machine parts—were examined
for defective parts. The number of defective parts was recorded for each box, and the
average (arithmetic mean) of the 50 recorded numbers of defective parts per box was
1.12. Only one error was made in recording the 50 numbers: “1” defective part in a
certain box was incorrectly recorded as “10”.
Quantity A
The actual average number of defective parts per box

Questions 10 to 25 have several different formats. Unless otherwise directed, select a single answer choice. For
Numeric Entry questions, follow the instructions below.
Numeric Entry Questions
Enter your answer in the answer box(es) below the question.
Your answer may be an integer, a decimal, or a fraction, and it may be negative.
If a question asks for a fraction, there will be two boxes—one for the numerator and one for the
denominator.
Equivalent forms of the correct answer, such as 2.5 and 2.50, are all correct. Fractions do not need to be
reduced to lowest terms.
Enter the exact answer unless the question asks you to round your answer.
